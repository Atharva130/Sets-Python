# Sets in Python

## Introduction
Sets are unordered collections of unique elements in Python. They are useful for membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries.

## Key Concepts
- Unordered and unindexed  
- No duplicate elements  
- Mutable but elements must be immutable  

## Topics to Learn
- Creating sets  
- Set methods (`add()`, `remove()`, `clear()`, etc.)  
- Set operations (`union`, `intersection`, `difference`, etc.)  
- Membership testing  
- Frozen sets (immutable sets)
